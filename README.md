# Budget Buddy
A tool that will allow users to track their spending and habits by regularly uploading their credit card statements. These statements will be normalized and aggregated to provide a cumulative, month-by-month analysis of spending habits. With this project, I aim to provide a robust, no-cost solution to help users manage their finances and promote responsible spending.

## How to use:
1. Download credit/debit card statements
2. Upload statements to the `./statements` directory.
3. Rename statements using our naming conventions listed below in this format: **bank-card_name**
4. Run the main script from the terminal with:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Naming Conventions of supported banks
- Capital One - **capone**
- Chase - **chase**
